Atraci for Android

The Atraci app for Android supports all devices up to API level 17 (4.2.2)
and uses the latest in Android Material design and convention. Because of this
two support libraries are needed in order to build this application.

    - android-support-v7-appcompat
	- android-support-v4-preferencefragment (https://github.com/kolavar/android-support-v4-preferencefragment)
